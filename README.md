# About Dominik Krebs

Hi, I'm Dominik from Nuremberg, Germany! 

As Technical Lead at [NETZKOLLEKTIV](https://netzkollektiv.com), I help companies find their way through the jungle of Magento, Shopware, wooCommerce and the technologies PHP, NodeJS, JavaScript, React, Vue and Co. We develop extensions, plugins and themes for these and other e-commerce systems, help merchants stay up to date with new technologies and solve performance problems.

Apart of my work I do Judo and Mountainbiking, woodworking or work in the garden. I am also interested in IOT, automation and small electronics projects.
